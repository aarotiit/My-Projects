# Portfolio

This portfolio is created using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It showcases my skill development as a first year software developer.

## Starting out

- First I wanted my portfolio to be clean and simple. Im starting out with the HTML.

## Next steps

- HTML basic structure is done. I added a header, navigation, main and a footer. Also put some content in the header and navigation. Also did some JS for the mobile menu toggle.

- Next I will add some content to the main section and start styling with CSS.

- Made some progress with css.
